# Big Data and Cloud Computing Archive

This repository showcases my hands-on exercises, assignments, and technical reports related to Big Data and Cloud Computing. It covers various topics, including Apache Spark, machine learning on big data, and cloud computing using AWS services. Additionally, it includes two technical reports, which were collaborative projects.

## Contents

### 1. Exercises and Assignments

In the `exercises-assignments` directory, you'll find a collection of hands-on exercises and assignments as python scripts and notebooks that I completed to learn and apply Big Data and Cloud Computing concepts. The exercises cover:

- Apache Spark: DataFrame API, SQL API, and Pandas API on Spark.
- Machine Learning on Spark: Training machine learning models on large datasets.
- Cloud Computing: Utilizing AWS EC2 for virtual machines, AWS EMR for distributed computing, and AWS S3 for data storage and model storage.

### 2. Technical Reports

The `technical-reports` directory contains two in-depth technical reports:

#### Leveraging Big Data Techniques and Analytics for Enhanced Understanding of Dota 2 Match Dynamics

In this report, we leveraged Big Data techniques to perform exploratory data analysis on a substantial 16 GB dataset related to Dota 2 match dynamics. We used Apache Spark for data processing and analysis. The dataset was sourced from [Academic Torrents](https://academictorrents.com/collection/opendota-formerly-yasp-data-dumps).

#### Insights from Big Data: A Cloud-Based Data Analysis of COVID-19 Scientific Literature

In this report, we detail our cloud-based data analysis of COVID-19 scientific literature using AWS services. We employed AWS EMR for data processing and analysis of a dataset from the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/cord-19/). The report provides valuable insights gained from the analysis.
