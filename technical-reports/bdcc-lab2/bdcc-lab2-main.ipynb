    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "    &emsp; Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved from a local outbreak into a global pandemic, leaving no corner of the world untouched. Caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths worldwide and has become a grave public health concern, demanding immediate attention and robust research efforts.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "    &emsp; The speed and scale at which COVID-19 has spread necessitated a similarly swift and widespread response from the global scientific community. Researchers across diverse disciplines have come together to increase our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its transmission mechanisms, the disease it causes, potential treatments, vaccines, and the societal impacts of the pandemic. As a result, an enormous body of scientific literature has been generated in an incredibly short span of time. This pool of research provides a vast trove of data, the analysis of which can yield critical insights into the collective global response to the pandemic.\n",

    "\n",
    "<h1 style=\"color: #8936E0\"><b>Problem Statement</b></h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "    &emsp; As COVID-19 research proliferates at an astounding pace, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay abreast with the rapidly-evolving focus and dynamics within this research landscape. Moreover, traditional data analysis techniques struggle to handle the sheer volume, velocity, and variety of data, thereby limiting the scope and depth of insights.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "    &emsp; This project proposes to leverage the power of big data analytics and cloud computing to tackle these challenges. By examining the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), we aim to identify trends and shifts in research focus, thereby providing an overarching view of the global scientific community's response to the pandemic. Additionally, we aim to highlight the most influential contributors, institutions, and countries in this sphere.\n",

Primarily, with the vast amount of COVID-19 research available, employing big data techniques can provide profound insights into the trajectory of scientific efforts made worldwide. Understanding this trajectory can guide future research directions, offering a roadmap for researchers and policy-makers alike.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "    &emsp;Secondly, identifying key contributors, institutions, and countries in COVID-19 research can help foster collaborative efforts, bridging gaps between different scientific communities. The goal is to highlight the pioneering work done by various researchers and institutions, thus recognizing their contributions, promoting the exchange of ideas, and inspiring future research collaborations. We believe that fostering such an environment can significantly expedite the progress in managing the current crisis and preparing for similar situations in the future.\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "    &emsp;The methodology adopted for this project entailed the application of big data techniques, particularly Apache Spark, within a cloud computing environment. Python was the primary programming language used, given its versatility and the availability of numerous libraries that support data processing, analysis, and visualization. The procedure encompassed the following steps:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Data Preparation.</b> Given that our dataset, CORD-19, is substantial and in the machine-readable JSON format, the first step was to extract and prepare this data for processing in a distributed system like Spark. This involved converting the dataset into a format that can be distributed across multiple nodes. We used PySpark, the Python library for Spark, to read the JSON files, and then transformed the data into a distributed data structure called Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). RDD is a fundamental data structure of Spark that allows data to be distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster, thereby facilitating parallel processing. <b>More details on this process, including the code used, can be found in supplementary notebooks <u>supp-transfer-data.ipynb</u> and <u>supp-parquet.ipynb</u>.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Setting Up Amazon EMR and Loading Data onto Spark.</b> The second step was to set up an Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) cluster. Amazon EMR is a cloud-based big data platform that allows the processing of large datasets using popular distributed computing frameworks such as Spark.Once the EMR cluster was set up, we used the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to distribute the dataset across the nodes in the cluster. This step ensured that the data was ready to be processed by Spark in a distributed and parallelized manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis.</b> With the data distributed across the EMR cluster and loaded onto Spark, we proceeded to the data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase.We employed various Spark transformations and actions on the RDDs to clean and preprocess the data, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and filtering irrelevant information. For the EDA, we formulated and executed Spark DataFrame queries to answer our research questions. We investigated the top contributors, institutions, and countries and examined trends and shifts in research focus in the COVID-19 literature. <b>The pre-processing and plot generation codes can be found in the supplementary notebooks <u>supp-eda.ipynb</u></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Summarization and Visualization.</b> The final step was to summarize the insights obtained from the EDA and create visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of the data. We utilized Python's data visualization libraries, such as Plotly, to generate plots and charts that represented our findings. These visualizations provided an intuitive and accessible way to understand the trends and patterns unearthed from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "    &emsp;In summary, our methodology employed big data techniques, especially Spark, to handle, process, and analyze the large CORD-19 dataset. The cloud-based nature of Amazon EMR allowed us to leverage distributed computing for efficient data processing and analysis. The insights derived from our project highlight the potential of such techniques in making sense of large and complex scientific datasets.\n",

    "<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Continual Analysis.</b> The CORD-19 dataset is regularly updated with new research papers, and as such, the data analyzed in this project represents a snapshot in time. Future efforts should aim to set up a continual or real-time analysis pipeline to stay up-to-date with the latest research trends and shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Expanding the Scope of Analysis.</b> Our analysis primarily focused on identifying top contributors, institutions, and countries. While these aspects are important, future projects could expand the scope to include more detailed analyses, such as thematic trends in research, co-authorship networks, citation analysis, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Integrating Additional Datasets.</b> While the CORD-19 dataset is comprehensive, integrating additional datasets could enhance the analysis. For example, incorporating citation databases could provide insights into the influence of specific papers or authors. Including non-English research papers could broaden the scope and inclusivity of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP).</b> The CORD-19 dataset contains a wealth of textual data, ripe for analysis via Natural Language Processing techniques. Using NLP, future work could perform more nuanced analyses, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or text classification to further understand the content and trends within the research papers."
